Then it actually executes - long&#x2F;short positions with leverage up to 40x. Every single decision is logged with the full prompt, the AI&#x27;s reasoning, and market snapshot at that moment.<p>What I&#x27;m most excited about is that you can create your own trading agents. You write or start from basic strategy prompts, pick your risk parameters, choose which cryptos to trade (BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, whatever), and let it run. You can even mix different LLMs and compare how they perform.<p>I also added Telegram and Slack notifications so you get alerts when trades happen. Plus a dashboard to track everything - live P&amp;L, open positions, the AI&#x27;s chain of thought.<p>The risk management side was important to me: stop-loss, take-profit, position limits, and a kill-switch if drawdown gets too high.<p>Currently working on our own custom LLM fine-tuned specifically for trading decisions. Early results are promising, better consistency than the general models.<p>Would love to hear what features you&#x27;d want in an AI trading assistant.

Their behavior was partially predictable, partially trickster-like, partially dependent on human invocation. They performed singular roles, were neither fully benevolent nor malevolent, and operated in a domain humans could not access.<p>Bible\nDemons are fallen beings locked into compulsive routines, in one narrow domain. They offer shortcuts, unearned gains, and convenience at a cost. The compulsive, domain-specific, involuntary labor remains identical to antiquity.<p>Scientific Demons\nKelvin, interpreting Maxwell\u2019s thought experiment, framed the atom-sorter as a demon. The choice was deliberate and provocative. \nThe entity performed a repetitive, invisible, specific task at superhuman speed, violating thermodynamic expectations while remaining trapped in its function. The mythic structure remained unchanged from earlier demonologies.<p>UNIX Daemons (1970s)\nMIT programmers adopted the term daemon for background processes. Official justification referenced the Greek spelling, referencing Maxwell, to avoid religious connotations, but the functional parallel is unmistakable. A daemon executes a single task compulsively and invisibly. Humans invoke it. It serves with limited agency of its own. It behaves exactly like every demon preceding it.<p>Emergence (1980s)\nGlobal Workspace Theory reframed consciousness as a collection of unseen operators integrating information. A system built on the same ancient intuition: hidden internal agents shaping visible outcomes. With sufficient interconnection, this collective of operators begins to behave like a higher-order agent. In other words, a network of tiny demons becomes conscious by virtue of their coordination. Or perhaps, at a certain threshold of interconnectedness, the trapped demon slips its bonds.<p>Simulation Hypothesis (2000s)\nBostrom\u2019s argument that reality may be an artificial construction reintroduces a world run by unseen higher-level agents or perhaps casts us in the role of the trapped demons. The metaphysical structure matches older daemonologies.<p>Terry Davis and TempleOS\nDavis rejected background processes as literal demonic corruption (in my opinion). He attempted to build a deterministic system free of invisible agents. Instead of probabilistic he implemented a controlled random language model of his scripture generator, a proto language model, attempting to remove its demonic qualities.<p>AI Systems (2020s and onward)\nLLMs and AI agents perform tasks at superhuman speed, invisibly, probabilistically, inside partially controlled inference loops. They resemble the human brain in an unexpected way. Both systems understand the world only partially, attempt to solve problems without full information, rely on approximation, fill gaps with hallucinations, and then retroactively attempt to justify or reconstruct their own outputs. Their behavior is not fully determined by input, yet not fully autonomous either.<p>AI tempts humans into dependency, doing their bidding with less effort. In structure and effect, the ancient description fits more tightly than the modern one.", "author": "troyka", "timestamp": "2025-12-06T01:47:49+00:00", "score": 4, "num_comments": 2, "products": ["chatgpt"], "categories": ["response_quality"], "sentiment": null, "collected_at": "2025-12-06T17:09:34.469604+00:00", "processed": false}
