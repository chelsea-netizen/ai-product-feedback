It&#x27;s a Python framework for building AI agents, but heavily inspired by the philosophy of &quot;Glass Box&quot; engineering rather than magical &quot;Black Boxes&quot;.<p>The Problem:\nMost agent frameworks today (LangChain, AutoGen) feel like magic. They hide the prompt chains, the state transitions, and the retry logic. When they break in production, debugging is a nightmare.<p>The Solution:\nL\u00e1r is designed to be the &quot;PyTorch for Agents&quot;. It uses a &quot;Define-by-Run&quot; architecture where:\n1. Agents are just directed graphs (Nodes + Edges).\n2. Every state transition is immutable and logged.\n3. The engine produces a JSON &quot;Flight Log&quot; that makes the agent 100% auditable (useful for 21 CFR Part 11 compliance in healthcare&#x2F;finance).<p>Tech Stack:\n- IDE Friendly: Clone, `pip install`, and run. Build an agent in minutes.\n- Zero Friction Models: Switch from Cloud to Local in 1 line. Just change `&quot;gpt-4&quot;` to `&quot;ollama&#x2F;phi4&quot;`. No code refactoring.\n- Hybrid Architecture: We proved that using code for logic (instead of LLMs) makes L\u00e1r <i>60x cheaper</i> and significantly faster than standard &quot;Chain&quot; frameworks.\n- Enterprise Patterns: Includes <i>18 Core Patterns</i> out of the box (e.g., A&#x2F;B Testing, Resumable Graphs, Security Firewalls).\n- Just-in-Time Integrations: Don&#x27;t wait for API wrappers. Drag our &quot;Integration Builder&quot; prompt into your IDE and get a type-safe tool in 30 seconds.\n- Air-Gap Capable: No telemetry, no hidden clouds. Run entirely offline.<p>It\u2019s open source (Apache 2.0).
