I initially built it to help me build my first &quot;real&quot; iOS app, and it made the process so fun and productive that I wanted to share it.<p>I recently christened it v1.0, but I continue to evolve it quickly. It&#x27;s biased toward modern frameworks and best practices, but I continue to notably broaden coverage every week. Here are the technologies and concepts Axiom currently has deep coverage for:<p>\u2022 Swift &amp; Concurrency \u2014 Swift 6 strict concurrency, actors, Sendable, @MainActor, async&#x2F;await, data race prevention, actor isolation patterns<p>\u2022 SwiftUI \u2014 Performance optimization with Instruments, navigation architecture (NavigationStack, NavigationSplitView, deep linking), adaptive layout (ViewThatFits, AnyLayout), debugging view updates and preview crashes, gestures, Liquid Glass<p>\u2022 Data &amp; Sync \u2014 SwiftData, SQLiteData (Point-Free), GRDB, Core Data (migrations, thread-confinement, N+1 queries), Codable&#x2F;JSON, CloudKit (CKSyncEngine, conflict resolution), iCloud Drive, file protection, Realm \u2192 SwiftData migration<p>\u2022 Debugging &amp; Performance \u2014 Memory leak patterns (timers, observers, closures, delegates), Instruments workflows (Time Profiler, Allocations, Leaks), Xcode build failures, Network.framework diagnostics, Auto Layout conflicts, build optimization<p>\u2022 Design &amp; Accessibility \u2014 Human Interface Guidelines, VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, WCAG compliance, color contrast, touch targets, typography (San Francisco, text styles)<p>\u2022 Apple Frameworks \u2014 Foundation Models&#x2F;Apple Intelligence, App Intents (Siri, Shortcuts, Spotlight), StoreKit 2 (subscriptions, transactions), AVFoundation (audio sessions, spatial audio), WidgetKit, Live Activities, TextKit 2, Now Playing<p>Although I&#x27;m a junior iOS developer, I&#x27;ve built a bunch of AI tools. As with all useful ones, what makes Axiom perform so much better than foundation models alone is the thoughtful curation and optimization of the knowledge management at the heart of its capabilities. For example, I&#x27;ve spent a bunch of time &quot;encoding&quot; knowledge from WWDC sessions into relevant components, which gives Axiom a unique and useful &quot;POV&quot; that, in many cases, isn&#x27;t covered in Apple&#x27;s reference docs.<p>Any and all feedback&#x2F;criticism is welcome! I&#x27;ll use it to improve Axiom for everyone. If you use Claude Code, I&#x27;d appreciate if you could try one or two of the audit commands (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;charleswiltgen.github.io&#x2F;Axiom&#x2F;commands&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;charleswiltgen.github.io&#x2F;Axiom&#x2F;commands&#x2F;</a>) on your codebase.", "author": "CharlesW", "timestamp": "2025-12-14T17:04:33+00:00", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "products": ["claude"], "categories": ["navigation"], "sentiment": null, "collected_at": "2025-12-14T17:09:01.644130+00:00", "processed": false}

What motivated it was wanting a customizable version of Wispr Flow where I could fully control the models, formatting, and behavior of the system, rather than relying on a black box.<p>Tambourine is built directly on top of Pipecat and relies on its modular voice agent framework. The back end is a local Python server that uses Pipecat to stitch together STT and LLM models into a single pipeline. This modularity is what makes it easy to swap providers, experiment with different setups, and maintain fine-grained control over the voice AI.<p>I shared an early version with friends and recently presented it at my local Claude Code meetup. The response was overwhelmingly positive, and I was encouraged to share it more widely.<p>The desktop app is built with Tauri. The front end is written in TypeScript, while the Tauri layer uses Rust to handle low level system integration. This enables the registration of global hotkeys, management of audio devices, and reliable text input at the cursor on both Windows and macOS.<p>At a high level, Tambourine gives you a universal voice interface across your OS. You press a global hotkey, speak, and formatted text is typed directly at your cursor. It works across emails, documents, chat apps, code editors, and terminals.<p>Under the hood, audio is streamed from the TypeScript front end to the Python server via WebRTC. The server runs real-time transcription with a configurable STT provider, then passes the transcript through an LLM that removes filler words, adds punctuation, and applies custom formatting rules and a personal dictionary. STT and LLM providers, as well as prompts, can be switched without restarting the app.<p>The project is still under active development. I am working through edge cases and refining the UX, and there will likely be breaking changes, but most core functionality already works well and has become part of my daily workflow.<p>I would really appreciate feedback, especially from anyone interested in the future of voice as an interface.", "author": "kstonekuan", "timestamp": "2025-12-14T16:21:35+00:00", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "products": ["claude"], "categories": ["response_quality"], "sentiment": null, "collected_at": "2025-12-14T17:09:03.043172+00:00", "processed": false}
