It\u2019s not like I\u2019m making terrible investment decisions, it\u2019s more about not being able to consistently manage my portfolio. I\u2019m getting distracted by other projects, leaving my portfolio in free float, which, ultimately, doesn\u2019t work great.<p>So, the idea was to create a reasonable portfolio manager that watches your portfolio, and alerts you (relatively infrequently) when the action is needed. I\u2019m not looking to YOLO to the moon, I\u2019m looking for some reasonable, middle-of-the-road advice and consistent monitoring. This is why I built my portfolio manager, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portfoliogenius.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portfoliogenius.ai</a><p>In the spirit of putting my money where my mouth is, I have $50k to manage since July this year. Currently, it\u2019s about 7.5% up, which is consistent with the goal I gave it - moderate risk portfolio, with some crypto exposure. Yes, S&amp;P was up 12%, but it is expected given that I aimed for lower risk, and a large portion of the portfolio is bonds and treasury ETFs. The performance was hurt by the recent BTC slide, but thankfully it insisted on keeping the crypto sleeve small, about 5% of the whole portfolio.<p>There were a few things that surprised me. Some investment choices are conventional, but some are quite interesting. For example, it recommended buying ICLN back in July (global clean energy ETF), which was strange given the political climate. But I resolved to do everything it recommends, so I did. ICLN is up 25% since.<p>I also had plenty of fun running portfolios managed by different models to compare performance. So far, Gemini 3 Pro seems to be the best, but it may very well change in the longer run.<p>For the tech stack, I use LangChain with a bunch of tools - Tiingo for stock&#x2F;crypto prices, Brave for news&#x2F;web search, and my custom news processing service which summarizes daily news and generates macro economic snapshots. I also have some custom tools to help with the tasks such as portfolio design and trade recommendations.<p>The platform is free for now, and I intend to keep it free for the early adopters (give away premium subscriptions when it is introduced).<p>I would be grateful for any feedback, specifically if you feel that such a tool can be useful for you, and what functionality would you like to see.", "author": "regnull", "timestamp": "2025-12-15T14:50:13+00:00", "score": 4, "num_comments": 2, "products": ["gemini"], "categories": ["general_ux"], "sentiment": null, "collected_at": "2025-12-15T17:18:03.042953+00:00", "processed": false}
