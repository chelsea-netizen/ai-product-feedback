It felt like an entirely new art form; Every piece was a collage made of all the written works that came before it.<p>But, the issue is that all of the interfaces for them have sucked.<p>The original OpenAI playground interface was incredibly limited. Then, Loom came along and showed the world the possibilities of branching LLM interfaces. The concept was incredible, but the actual interface was buggy and felt incredibly confusing and alien.<p>Loomsidian was the first branching base model interface I liked. It was really easy to use but it felt painfully limited. Exoloom came after it, and again, the concept was great but the interface just kinda sucked.<p>So, after trying all these different interfaces, I decided to try to learn from their mistakes and make something better.<p>My new interface is called Tapestry Loom. It&#x27;s still a work in progress, and there&#x27;s a lot more I want to add to it, but I think it has finally reached a point where it&#x27;s ready for other people to try.<p>Let me know you think.", "author": "transkatgirl", "timestamp": "2025-12-18T17:00:31+00:00", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "products": ["chatgpt"], "categories": ["content_clarity"], "sentiment": null, "collected_at": "2025-12-18T17:15:39.350324+00:00", "processed": false}
