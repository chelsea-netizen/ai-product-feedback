**Assessing Model Identity**

I'm wrestling with the user's direct question about my identity. The context is this futuristic scenario where advanced models like &quot;ChatGPT 5.1&quot; and &quot;Gemini 3&quot; are supposedly released in late 2025. Given the system prompt states the current time as November 19, 2025, I'm trying to reconcile the fictional date with ...</div>

Like many of you, I was eager to test the new Gemini 3 Pro!

I’ve just kicked off a chess game between **GPT-5.1 (White)** and **Gemini 3 Pro (Black)** on the *LLM Chess Arena* app I developed a few months ago.

A single game can take a while (sometimes several hours!), so I thought it would be fun to share the live link with you all!

            <div class="text">I’m an avid Claude user, and I’m wondering if anyone knows of any browser plugins or extensions that lets users customize Claude’s interface to make it more visually appealing and engaging. I know similar UI-tweaking extensions exist for ChatGPT (which has a very bland UI), but I haven’t been able to find anything comparable for Claude.

Thanks in advance.</div>

            <div class="text">Claude Code is great, but it’s focused on coding. The missing piece is a native way to build and run custom background agents for non-code tasks. We built RowboatX as a CLI tool modeled after Claude Code that lets you do that. It uses the file system and unix tools to create and monitor background agents for everyday tasks, connect them to any MCP server for tools, and reason over their outputs.&lt;p...</div>

            <div class="text">Hey everyone,

I'm working on a personal project (AI for agriculture) and I just spent 20+ hours non-stop fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Omni-3B. I’d like your opinion: is what I did considered complex, or did I just suffer for nothing?

My goal
