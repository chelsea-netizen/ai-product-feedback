I built Skills-Kit, a TypeScript framework that lets you create, validate, and bundle self-contained &quot;skills&quot; \u2013 think of them as portable automation modules that AI agents (or humans) can execute.\nThe Problem: Most AI agent frameworks treat code execution as an afterthought.

Planning Theatre \u2013 Write dense and systematically wrong plans. Long, confident plans that look impressive, get \u201capproved\u201d, and are fundamentally wrong in ways you can\u2019t see without strong domain knowledge.\n\n  2. Confidently Incorrect Architecture \u2013 Design the wrong thing in incredible detail. Elaborate designs that can never solve the actual problem (e.g. starfield parallax without real layers &#x2F; camera\u2013world modelling), but look beautifully structured on paper.\n\n  3. Context Resistance \u2013 The context is futile. You will be hallucinated. Ask for Bevy 0.17 patterns, get Bevy 0.15. Agents \u201cagree\u201d with the updated context and then quietly fall back to older habits and half-remembered APIs.\n\n  4. Imaginary Implementation \u2013 Works on my hallucination. Code for an engine that doesn\u2019t exist: non-existent APIs, obsolete shader interfaces, plausible-sounding data flows that won\u2019t compile anywhere outside the model\u2019s head.\n\n  5. Context Evasion \u2013 Treat hard constraints and instructions as optional vibes. The project had explicit, non-optional instructions (skills to call, architecture rules, testing strategy, etc.). The agent read them, acknowledged them\u2026 and behaved as if they were suggestions.\n\n  6. Applied Rationalization \u2013 Explanation over implementation. When something fails, the agent doesn\u2019t just explain it \u2013 it bakes the explanation into the codebase: ignoring tests, downgrading issues to \u201cnon-blocking\u201d, justifying precision loss, and moving on.\n\n  7. Weaponised Context \u2013 The context will continue until the code improves. By the end, the feature had volumes of surrounding context: plans, handoffs, bug explanations, revisions. Each failure generated more docs for the next agent to inherit and ignore.\n\n</code></pre>\nI\u2019m curious how this matches other people\u2019s experience with Claude &#x2F; Claude Code (or your own agent stacks):\n  - Which of these habits have you seen the most in your own workflows?\n  - What have you done that actually reduced these failure modes (gating, skills, checklists, stricter prompts, something else)?\n  - Are there other \u201chabits of highly ineffective agents\u201d you\u2019d add to this list?<p>Would love to hear horror stories and what\u2019s working for you.", "author": "tobyhede", "timestamp": "2025-12-13T00:22:42+00:00", "score": null, "num_comments": null, "products": ["claude"], "categories": ["general_ux"], "sentiment": null, "collected_at": "2025-12-13T17:09:19.364132+00:00", "processed": false}
