So until those systems don&#x27;t become much more intelligent and reliable, the human in the loop is an unavoidable precondition to successfully use those tools.

We&#x27;re Marko and Darko, building SuperPlane with a small team. SuperPlane is an open source DevOps control plane for running event-driven workflows. It works across the tools teams already use like Git, CI&#x2F;CD, incident response, observability, infra, notifications, etc.<p>You can think of SuperPlane as &#x27;n8n&#x2F;Zapier for DevOps&#x27;.<p>How do we do DevOps today? For many teams it&#x27;s a mix of brittle scripts, one-off CI jobs, bespoke GitOps, and manual approvals scattered across channels.<p>Pipelines are often the only workflow engine available, but they\u2019re not a great fit when a workflow needs to span multiple repos&#x2F;tools, wait for humans, or run over hours and days. Previously we built a CI&#x2F;CD company Semaphore so we&#x27;ve seen it first-hand.<p>SuperPlane gives you a place to model these workflows as a system: connect your tools, define how events flow, and get a complete, queryable execution history for debugging, audit, and shared understanding.<p>Examples of what you can do with SuperPlane today:<p>- Cross-tool automation with guardrails: coordinate releases with approvals, time windows, checks, and rollback paths.<p>- Human-in-the-loop operations: pause for sign-off, collect decisions, and resume where you left off.<p>- Incident and on-call workflows: pull context from multiple systems, fan out notifications, and keep a work log.<p>- Glue work you don&#x27;t want to re-build: webhooks, retries, routing, payload transforms, and a unified run history.<p>See pre-built examples in the docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.superplane.com&#x2F;get-started&#x2F;example-use-cases&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.superplane.com&#x2F;get-started&#x2F;example-use-cases&#x2F;</a><p>Project status:<p>- Self-hosted only right now, alpha release.
