**Assessing Model Identity**

I'm wrestling with the user's direct question about my identity. The context is this futuristic scenario where advanced models like &quot;ChatGPT 5.1&quot; and &quot;Gemini 3&quot; are supposedly released in late 2025. Given the system prompt states the current time as November 19, 2025, I'm trying to reconcile the fictional date with ...</div>

Like many of you, I was eager to test the new Gemini 3 Pro!

I’ve just kicked off a chess game between **GPT-5.1 (White)** and **Gemini 3 Pro (Black)** on the *LLM Chess Arena* app I developed a few months ago.

A single game can take a while (sometimes several hours!), so I thought it would be fun to share the live link with you all!

I wanted to tell you about a litte project I built together with Claude. I’ve been working in web design for about 20 years, doing both frontend and backend work. I usually program in PHP, use Laravel, and work CMS like statamic, kirby and TYPO3.

Introduction

Latent Space in AI is the compressed, lower-dimensional representation of data used in AI to capture essential features and patterns. Where similar points cluster together closely. AI uses this space to make meaningful connections and generate outputs based on the patterns it has processed.
