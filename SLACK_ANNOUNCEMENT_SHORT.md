## 📣 New Resource: AI Product Feedback Tracker

👋 Hi team! I built an automated tracker that collects real-world UX feedback about AI products from Reddit, HackerNews, and Twitter.

### 🔗 **https://chelsea-netizen.github.io/ai-product-feedback/**

**What it tracks:**
- ✅ UX/UI content treatments (layout, formatting, readability)
- ✅ Tone & voice feedback (how AI assistants sound)
- ✅ Onboarding wins & confusion (what users discover or miss)

**How it works:**
- Collects ~100 items daily from public sources
- Filters for AI products + UX topics
- Updates automatically at 9 AM PST

**Example insights (actual quotes captured):**
- "ChatGPT 5.1 Is Collapsing Under Its Own Guardrails"
- "How to get Claude Code/Codex to match Lovable's UX/UI quality?"
- "How to stop chatgpt from saying it's not x, it's y all the time?"
- "Forget AGI—Sam Altman celebrates ChatGPT finally following em dash formatting rules"

**Current tracking:**
Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Perplexity, Grok
