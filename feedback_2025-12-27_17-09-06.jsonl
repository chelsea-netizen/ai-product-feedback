The criticism isn&#x27;t 100% wrong - macro models fail to predict recessions, policy prescriptions conflict, economists famously disagree about everything. When people hate economics, they&#x27;re hating the outputs - the semi-working modelling of complex reality, but not engaging with the tools that economists actually use. Opportunity cost isn&#x27;t a model as such, it&#x27;s a thinking tool: &quot;What&#x27;s the next-best use of this resource?&quot; That operation remains valuable whether or not any particular economic model works. Comparative advantage, marginal thinking, stock-flow distinctions, mechanism design - all of these are lenses to look at reality that transfer to problems far outside economics.<p>So I used Claude to extract the tools from economics domain and then realized the pattern applied everywhere.
