Or is Anthropic particularly bad at the non-AI aspects of running a SaaS business?\nGave leadership until Dec 9 for substantive response. Received on 12&#x2F;4:\n\u201cI&#x27;ve consulted with my supervisor about your specific case and I&#x27;m sorry to hear you&#x27;re still periodically experiencing these issues. I understand your frustration, thank you for your patience. Some artifact display issues remain intermittent, and our engineering team is continuing to investigate and improve the experience. You can check here for updates on any ongoing incidents.\nThank you for sharing this feedback\u2014it helps us understand what matters most to you and informs how we build Claude going forward.\u201d\nThis is representative of all the responses I\u2019ve gotten. Note: it only addresses one of the three issues I\u2019ve been asking about, assumes (incorrectly) that the problems I\u2019m experiencing are intermittent, and provides no tangible, practical information. It also has no ticket number since they don\u2019t seem to generate them.\nAny other customers experiencing similar issues?", "author": "AnonHere", "timestamp": "2025-12-05T12:03:15+00:00", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "products": ["claude"], "categories": ["navigation", "response_quality"], "sentiment": null, "collected_at": "2025-12-05T17:11:30.983720+00:00", "processed": false}

While standard LLMs can suggest logic, they often &quot;hallucinate&quot; nodes that don&#x27;t exist, get parameter names wrong, or output JSON structures that n8n can&#x27;t actually import.<p>The Solution I built a specialized RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. I indexed two thousands of working, verified n8n workflows. When you describe a task, the system retrieves relevant, valid workflow snippets to ground the LLM&#x27;s response. This significantly reduces hallucinations and ensures the output is import-ready.<p>Key Features:<p>Visual Preview: You don&#x27;t just get JSON; I built a UI that renders the n8n workflow preview directly in the browser so you can verify the logic before exporting.<p>Prompt Refiner (&quot;Improve&quot;): Writing detailed technical specs is hard. This button takes a vague idea (e.g., &quot;sync hubspot to slack&quot;) and rewrites it into a highly detailed, technical prompt optimized for the generator.<p>Interactive Context (&quot;Ask&quot;): A Q&amp;A copilot to answer questions about nodes and logic or troubleshoot concepts before generation.<p>The Tech Stack I decided to use a bleeding-edge stack for this:<p>Frontend: Next.js and Tailwind CSS.<p>AI&#x2F;RAG: OpenRouter API (GPT models) and Qdrant (Vector DB).<p>Backend: Supabase (Auth &amp; DB), Next.js Serverless Functions.<p>UI Components: react-markdown, react-syntax-highlighter, and the official n8n component for the visualization.<p>I\u2019d love to hear your feedback on the generation quality and the UI experience.", "author": "ronanren", "timestamp": "2025-12-05T11:24:11+00:00", "score": 2, "num_comments": 2, "products": ["copilot"], "categories": ["response_quality"], "sentiment": null, "collected_at": "2025-12-05T17:11:32.828989+00:00", "processed": false}
