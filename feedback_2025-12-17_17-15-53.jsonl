I recently left a 7-year career in Data Science and started to build my own tool.<p>The problem I faced was tool fragmentation. To do content marketing on social media, I was context-switching between LLMs for copy, meme databases for visuals, and Buffer for scheduling. It was inefficient.<p>I built Post2X to unify this entire stack into one flow. My internal benchmark is to create and schedule 100+ posts in under 1 hour, allowing me to batch my content marketing work and get back to coding.<p>How the workflow achieves that speed:<p>* Unified Drafting (Voice &amp; Text): You provide the input&#x2F;topics, and it generates drafts using a &quot;Voice Mimicry&quot; layer so the output sounds like you or the username you provided, not a generic bot.<p>* Integrated Visuals: No need to switch tabs to find images. You can generate images via prompt directly in the editor, or pull from trending memes to add context to your posts.<p>* Heuristic Scoring: Instead of guessing if a post is good, the tool grades drafts before you publish. Note: This isn&#x27;t just historical regression; it scores text based on specific writing heuristics (Hook strength, Clarity, Replyability, Tension, and more).<p>* One-Tap Queueing: I removed the friction of manual scheduling dates. You set your &quot;slots&quot; once, and then push content to the queue (for both X and LinkedIn) with a single click.<p>Tech Stack: TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Python, Supabase, OpenAI API, Gemini API, X API<p>It is free to try. (No credit-card required)<p>I\u2019d love feedback on the ecosystem flow.
