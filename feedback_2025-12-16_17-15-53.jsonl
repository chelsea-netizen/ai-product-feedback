I once read an article along the lines of \u201cWhat if computing resources were infinite,\u201d and it stuck with me.\n \u2022 If I had unlimited tokens (both context and usage), and an infinitely fast LLM, what could I do?\n 2.

I wanted to build something useless\u2014but fun.\n 5. Claude isn\u2019t just a code-generation model; it\u2019s a protocol that can access my computer.\n 6.
