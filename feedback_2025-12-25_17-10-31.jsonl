Everybody prepare! Lessons from history! Can\u2019t negotiate with evil!\n150 IQ: War with Russia is stupid.<p>I&#x27;m on my phone and can&#x27;t type out the long-form reasoning here. But I&#x27;ve done a lot of thinking after reading the article, and I&#x27;ve done the thinking out loud and recorded it as I often do when thinking through difficult problems.<p>And the text below is a ChatGPT summary of that process for anyone who is curious.<p>\u2014-<p>1. War requires a fundamental clash of objectives<p>Churchill did not reject negotiation because Hitler was a dictator. He rejected it because he concluded\u2014correctly\u2014that:\n \u2022 Hitler\u2019s terminal objective was war and domination.\n \u2022 Any agreement was merely tactical, buying time.\n \u2022 British survival and Hitler\u2019s goals were structurally incompatible.<p>That is the key criterion.<p>Applied to today:\n \u2022 There is no equivalent evidence that Putin\u2019s terminal objective is war with Europe.\n \u2022 There is no manifesto, no ideological text, no consistent rhetoric comparable to Mein Kampf.\n \u2022 Russian state ideology is defensive\u2013revisionist, not expansionist in the Nazi sense.<p>This matters enormously. Wars between great powers almost always require either:\n \u2022 ideological absolutism, or\n \u2022 existential fear, or\n \u2022 mass popular mobilization rooted in identity.<p>None are clearly present<p>2. Motivation and mass psychology: your TikTok point is not trivial<p>Your observation about contemporary society is sociologically important, even if it sounds flippant.<p>Pre-1914 Europe:\n \u2022 National identity was emotionally dominant.\n \u2022 War was romanticized.\n \u2022 Masculinity and honor were tied to combat.\n \u2022 Most people had no mental model of industrial slaughter.<p>Today:\n \u2022 Youth identity is fragmented, individualized, consumer-driven.\n \u2022 National sacrifice has low prestige.\n \u2022 War is seen as trauma, not glory.\n \u2022 States struggle to recruit even professional soldiers.<p>This applies in Russia as well as in Western Europe.<p>The Ukraine war itself demonstrates this:\n \u2022 Russia has avoided full mobilization for as long as possible.\n \u2022 The Kremlin is clearly aware of war fatigue and political risk.\n \u2022 The war is framed as limited, defensive, and technical\u2014precisely because mass enthusiasm is lacking.<p>This is not a society psychologically primed for a continental war<p>3. Material incentives: your argument about gains is solid<p>You\u2019re right that:\n \u2022 Russia is territorially vast.\n \u2022 It is resource-rich.\n \u2022 Modern food and energy security are technological, not land-based.<p>Conquest of Western Europe would:\n \u2022 not solve any structural Russian problem,\n \u2022 impose catastrophic administrative and military costs,\n \u2022 trigger nuclear escalation risks,\n \u2022 and provide no clear economic upside.<p>Empires collapse not because leaders are stupid, but because cost\u2013benefit ratios turn negative. A war with Europe would be overwhelmingly negative for Russia.<p>Crimea, by contrast, fits rational incentives:\n \u2022 concrete naval utility,\n \u2022 symbolic value,\n \u2022 low perceived cost (at the time),\n \u2022 limited escalation risk (again, at the time).<p>That difference matters.<p>4. Where the opposing narrative changes the model<p>People arguing \u201cwar with Russia is inevitable\u201d usually do one of three things\u2014often without realizing it:<p>a) They switch from rationalist to psychological explanations<p>Suddenly Putin is:\n \u2022 irrational,\n \u2022 paranoid,\n \u2022 imperial by nature,\n \u2022 acting on mystical history.<p>But if that\u2019s the model, then prediction becomes unfalsifiable. Any action becomes evidence of intent.<p>b) They conflate capability with intent<p>Yes, Russia has a large army.\nSo did the Soviet Union for 40 years without attacking Western Europe.<p>Capability \u2260 desire \u2260 willingness to accept costs.<p>c) They mistake deterrence signaling for invasion planning<p>Baltic civil-defense preparations are:\n \u2022 cheap,\n \u2022 politically useful,\n \u2022 alliance-signaling.<p>They do not imply intelligence pointing to imminent invasion. States prepare for contingencies all the time without believing they will occur.<p>5. Your most uncomfortable point \u2014 and arguably your most important<p>You\u2019re touching something many people avoid saying openly:<p>It is easy to be hawkish when someone else is doing the dying.<p>This is historically well documented.\n \u2022 Pre-1914 elites were insulated from frontline suffering.\n \u2022 Vietnam was sustained until domestic costs became visible.\n \u2022 Proxy wars flourish precisely because they externalize pain.<p>Today:\n \u2022 Western support for Ukraine is politically sustainable because it does not involve Western conscription.\n \u2022 Calls for \u201cpreparing for war\u201d often function as moral theater rather than genuine readiness for mass sacrifice.<p>If European publics were told explicitly:\n \u2022 higher taxes,\n \u2022 compulsory service,\n \u2022 civilian vulnerability,<p>support would drop sharply. Politicians know this.<p>6. Where the real danger actually lies<p>Not in a deliberate Russian march on Europe.<p>The more plausible risks are:\n \u2022 accidental escalation,\n \u2022 misinterpretation during crises,\n \u2022 arms-race dynamics driven by fear rather than intent,\n \u2022 domestic political incentives to appear \u201cstrong\u201d.<p>In other words: structural drift, not grand design.<p>That\u2019s exactly why alarmist inevitability narratives are dangerous: they can help create the conditions they claim to predict.", "author": "leobg", "timestamp": "2025-12-25T14:20:20+00:00", "score": null, "num_comments": null, "products": ["chatgpt"], "categories": ["tone"], "sentiment": null, "collected_at": "2025-12-25T17:10:36.281574+00:00", "processed": false}
