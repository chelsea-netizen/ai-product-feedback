That&#x27;s crucial for attracting and retaining casual users.<p>If you compare this to what Google was at the beginning, it was just a simple interface to search the web: no questions asked, no subscription, no login. That was one of the secrets that led people to adopt Google Search when it was new (the other being result quality). It was a refreshing, simple page where you typed something and got results without any friction.<p>Now, with Gemini, Google finally has an excellent LLM. But a casual user can&#x27;t use it unless they: 1. have a Google account, and 2. are logged in.<p>One might ask, &quot;What&#x27;s the matter? Everyone has a Google account.&quot; But the login requirement isn&#x27;t as harmless as it seems. For example, if you want to quickly show a friend Gemini on their PC, but they use Safari and aren&#x27;t logged into Google\u2014bummer, you can&#x27;t show them. Or a colleague asks about Gemini, but you can&#x27;t log in with a personal account on a work machine. Gemini is immediately excluded from the realm of possibility. In the good old days, anyone could use Google at work instantly.<p>Right now, the companies capturing users are OpenAI (with the accessible ChatGPT brand) and Microsoft (with Copilot integrated into Microsoft 365). My company, for instance, sent a memo stating we must use Copilot with our corporate accounts for data security.<p>Google has botched this. They don&#x27;t seem to understand that they are losing this round. They still have a strong position with Search and Android, but it\u2019s funny to watch them make this huge strategic mistake.<p>NOTE: Personally, I dislike ads unless they are privacy-friendly and discrete (like early Google). If OpenAI starts using invasive ads, I will stop using ChatGPT immediately, just as I stopped using Google Search in favor of Kagi.", "author": "frankohn", "timestamp": "2025-11-29T16:38:42+00:00", "score": null, "num_comments": null, "products": ["chatgpt", "gemini", "copilot"], "categories": ["response_quality"], "sentiment": null, "collected_at": "2025-11-29T17:09:28.537503+00:00", "processed": false}

I&#x27;m Rohan, co-founder of GitArsenal. We built an AI agent that automates the painful &quot;clone, install, build, test&quot; workflow that eats up 60-80% of developer time.\nThe problem: existing AI coding tools like Cursor and Copilot are great at writing code, but they break down at execution. Try to clone and run an unfamiliar repo and you&#x27;ll hit dependency conflicts, missing env vars, obscure build errors - all the friction that AI can&#x27;t currently handle.\nGitArsenal solves this by training specialized agents on setup execution traces. We achieved 40% accuracy on Terminal-Bench (outperforming many frontier models) and we&#x27;re working with GitHub and Microsoft research teams on SetupBench validation.\nWe&#x27;re using this as infrastructure for better AI coding agents - if your agent can&#x27;t reliably execute code, it can&#x27;t validate its own work. We&#x27;re partnering with Modal and E2B for execution environments.\nHit #6 on Product Hunt recently and seeing strong traction from teams at Hugging Face, Prime Intellect, and others who need to spin up repos constantly.\nOur approach is to build both the product and the dataset - setup execution traces are a unique moat since they capture real-world repository complexity that synthetic data can&#x27;t replicate.\nCurrently raising our pre-seed round ($500K) and would love feedback from the HN community.
