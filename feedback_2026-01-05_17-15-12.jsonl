To give some context on the difficulty here, an OpenAI agent placed 2nd in the AHC world tournament last August, so taking 1st place against 804 humans in this contest is a significant milestone for us. Our agent approached the production planning problem by running its own experiments during the contest. It independently discovered a Simulated Annealing strategy using a &quot;virtual power&quot; heuristic which ended up outperforming the greedy solutions that the problem setters anticipated.<p>We used inference-time scaling with GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro Preview to make this happen. The agent ran parallel code generation loops to iteratively refine the algorithm, costing about $1,300 in total compute for the 4 hour event. We published the full logs showing the agent&#x27;s analysis and code evolution at the link in the post.<p>Happy to answer any questions about the architecture!<p>Blog Post with details: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sakana.ai&#x2F;ahc058\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sakana.ai&#x2F;ahc058</a><p>For more technical detailed information, including the logs and analysis output by ALE-Agent during the contest, see: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sakanaai.github.io&#x2F;fishylene-ahc058&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sakanaai.github.io&#x2F;fishylene-ahc058&#x2F;</a>", "author": "hardmaru", "timestamp": "2026-01-05T15:41:31+00:00", "score": null, "num_comments": null, "products": ["chatgpt", "gemini"], "categories": ["tone", "response_quality"], "sentiment": null, "collected_at": "2026-01-05T17:15:18.199574+00:00", "processed": false}
