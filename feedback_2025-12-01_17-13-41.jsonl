We built an open-source desktop app that helps you run a lot of CLI coding agents like Claude Code, Codex, etc. in parallel on your machine.

We want to support and stay compatible with whatever CLI agents you already use - improving your workflow instead of replacing it.<p>How it works:\n- One-click Git worktree creation with automatic environment setup\n- Agents and terminal tabs are isolated per worktree, preventing conflicts\n- Push notifications when agents are done or need your input<p>This lets you, for example, have Codex writing end-to-end tests in one worktree while Claude Code refactors a different module \u2014 no waiting, no lost context.<p>What\u2019s next:\nWe think there\u2019s a big tooling + UX gap for orchestrating multiple agents. We\u2019re experimenting with:\n- GitHub-style diff viewer for quick in-app code review\n- Merge agent to automatically generate a PR from a worktree\n- Create and sync worktrees in cloud VM for mobile&#x2F;web access\n- Automatic context passing between agents using a top-level agent (e.g. Codex plan -&gt; Claude Code implementation -&gt; Codex review)<p>We\u2019ve been using Superset to build Superset, and it\u2019s made our coding 2-3x faster.

It turns out that this challenge became a little bigger (both in difficulty and scope) than I initially predicted. It was a fun challenge none-the-less.<p>I had a few goals when building the editor:<p>- Generate a schema definition that could be used to render frontend apps.<p>- Allow users to ONLY edit text content of the rendered app (I wanted to be stupidly simple to use).<p>- Allow jumping to different versions of the schema at different points in time in the chat history.<p>- Allow users to generate UI using their existing Angular components. I wanted to enable end-users to use existing assets. I felt like things like Lovable are too &quot;open-ended&quot; to be as useful.<p>Here&#x27;s a demo of what I built: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LcudrwsT_gk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LcudrwsT_gk</a>\nEditor Code: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graycoreio&#x2F;daffodil&#x2F;tree&#x2F;develop&#x2F;libs&#x2F;content&#x2F;editor\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graycoreio&#x2F;daffodil&#x2F;tree&#x2F;develop&#x2F;libs&#x2F;con...</a><p>I open sourced all of the code that I wrote (MIT License) and it comes in two pieces:<p>## Angular Editor &#x2F; Renderer<p>A pair of Angular components (and associated types&#x2F;supporting infrastructure) called the `DaffAiEditorComponent` and `DaffContentSchemaRenderer` that allow you to drop in page schema and edit&#x2F;visualize it. It can take a schema and produce a full page. This can be used as the foundation for building AI-driven content schema editors for any platform.\nCurrently, the editor can only be imported if you build the @daffodil&#x2F;content package locally (I\u2019m working on releasing this shortly!).<p>You can find the editor code here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graycoreio&#x2F;daffodil&#x2F;tree&#x2F;develop&#x2F;libs&#x2F;content&#x2F;editor\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graycoreio&#x2F;daffodil&#x2F;tree&#x2F;develop&#x2F;libs&#x2F;con...</a><p>You can find the frontend render here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graycoreio&#x2F;daffodil&#x2F;tree&#x2F;develop&#x2F;libs&#x2F;content&#x2F;renderer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graycoreio&#x2F;daffodil&#x2F;tree&#x2F;develop&#x2F;libs&#x2F;con...</a><p>## Magento CMS Plugin<p>A Magento&#x2F;MageOS module that embeds the editor in the CMS, calls OpenAI for prompt-based schema generation, and exposes the resulting schema via GraphQL so Daffodil storefronts (or any headless frontend) can render it.<p>If you have a Magento store, you can install it with:<p>```\ncomposer require graycore&#x2F;magento2-cms-ai-builder\n```<p>Repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graycoreio&#x2F;daffodil&#x2F;tree&#x2F;develop&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;magento&#x2F;cms-ai-builder\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graycoreio&#x2F;daffodil&#x2F;tree&#x2F;develop&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;...</a><p>I think the thing I\u2019m most proud of is the way that I came to the conclusion of patch generation. My early attempts at driving the model to target a full schema on each prompt became woefully slow within just a few conversation loops. Reducing the output tokens here was a big win for UX and latency. In addition to performance, the model would subtly change schema in various parts of the page at random which is less than stellar.<p>There\u2019s still a ton to do (I need to document all of the things and I need to make examples of rendering frontend apps with the admin content), but this was a huge milestone for me.<p>I plan to add streaming support to the Magento plugin along with the editor.

In the beginning I worked with Cursor for a few months and then moved over to Claude Code. I&#x27;ve been coding with Claude Code for the last few months now and it&#x27;s getting better every week.<p>At the start I just used it for coding, then I started using WP CLI commands to test and debug stuff. But over time I realized it can basically do anything for me. It can run bash scripts, PHP eval for quick small scripts, and it can create SQL queries 100x faster than I can (yes, I have 15 years of coding experience and my SQL still sucks, haha). I also realized it can set up plugins for me, activate them, be my strategic partner, analyze SEO content... I was doing all of this in my local (DDEV) environment.<p>But then it hit me. In all those 15 years, one of the most annoying things about WordPress development is that debugging production sites is slow and painful. Sure, you can copy your production files to local, copy the database, but then you need to think about connected systems that shouldn&#x27;t receive API calls and mess up your data. Meanwhile the production site keeps changing, new plugins get installed, I have to sync&#x2F;migrate everything etc. It would be so much easier to just work directly on production \u2014 run your debug scripts there, run your SQL queries on the real database with up-to-date data.<p>So I thought: wouldn&#x27;t it be awesome to have Claude Code on my production website? That way I can let it do anything I want on real-time data.<p>So I set up a Hetzner server, installed Claude Code, Apache, and Node.js. I created a folder to host my WordPress files and a server user for Claude with permissions limited to only the WordPress files directory. I set up a Node.js server on the same box in another folder and created a React chat interface. The requests from the interface go into the Node server, into Claude Code, and responses flow back through the same channel (see it in action here).<p>I installed an mu-plugin that enables the Node.js server to authenticate via REST, so I can use my admin login credentials to access the chat interface.<p>The result: a subdomain chat.example.com where I can log in and talk to Claude Code to diagnose errors, install plugins, write new blog posts, build landing pages, and make adjustments.<p>I use the CLAUDE.md file to prompt the agent to behave in a certain way \u2014 for example, to never change third-party plugin code without asking for my approval first.<p>I also gave it its own &quot;agent&quot; folder where it can store logs, snapshots (backups) and other stuff. I prompted it to create a JSON formatted log file in agent&#x2F;logs every time it makes a change to code or the database, so I have a history of all changes and can command it to reverse things if needed.<p>I also use the .claude folder to create sub-agents and slash commands, which I enabled in the chat interface. I&#x27;ll keep extending the library of expert agents \u2014 so it can be my theme developer following my WordPress coding standards, or do SEO research on my latest posts, add internal links, whatever I need.<p>Long story short: the sky is the limit and this 100x&#x27;s my output when working on my WordPress sites or my clients&#x27; sites. Bugs are found quickly now. I just log in, activate my @ diagnose agent, provide a report of what&#x27;s going wrong. It comes back with a plan, makes the changes with my approval, created a git commit, and logs everything so I can look it up later.<p>I&#x27;ve created a demo video. Check it out! I might create a business out of it and offer AI hosting with hundreds of sub agents, slash commands and an easy-to-use chat interface.<p>I call it: WP on Steroids!
