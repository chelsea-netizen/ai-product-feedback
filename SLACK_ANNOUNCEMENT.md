# Slack Announcement: AI Product Feedback Tracker

## 📣 Launching: AI Product Feedback Tracker

Hi team! 👋

I'm excited to share a new resource I've built to help us stay on top of real-world UX and content design feedback about AI products:

### 🔗 **https://chelsea-netizen.github.io/ai-product-feedback/**

---

## 🎯 What Is This?

An automated system that collects and curates public feedback about AI products (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc.) from Reddit, HackerNews, and Twitter.

Think of it as your daily digest of what users are actually saying about AI product experiences in the wild.

---

## 💡 What You'll Find

The tracker specifically surfaces three types of insights:

### 1. **UX/UI Content Treatments**
Preferences about how content is presented:
- Layout, spacing, readability issues
- "Wall of text" vs. well-formatted responses
- Dark mode, contrast, typography feedback
- Information architecture and organization

### 2. **Tone & Voice Feedback**
How AI assistants sound and communicate:
- "Claude sounds too formal/casual/robotic"
- Verbosity concerns ("over-explains" vs. "concise")
- Personality perception (warm, cold, patronizing, helpful)
- Response patterns that users love or find annoying

### 3. **Onboarding & Discovery**
What's confusing or successful when users get started:
- "Didn't realize you could do X"
- Hidden features users missed
- "Aha moments" when things finally clicked
- Learning curve feedback
- Feature discovery wins and pain points

---

## 🔍 How It Works

- **Automated**: Collects ~100 items daily from Reddit, HackerNews, and Twitter
- **Filtered**: Only surfaces posts mentioning AI products + UX/content topics
- **Categorized**: Tagged by product and feedback type
- **Fresh**: Updates daily at 9 AM PST
