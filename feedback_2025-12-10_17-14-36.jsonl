You write rules in policy-as-code (OPA&#x2F;Rego), and Cupcake integrates them into the agent runtime via Hooks.<p>See it in action (Desktop only): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cupcake-policy-studio.vercel.app&#x2F;example-policies&#x2F;security&#x2F;protecting-paths?harness=claude-code&amp;format=rego\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cupcake-policy-studio.vercel.app&#x2F;example-policies&#x2F;se...</a><p>Help us build: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;eqtylab&#x2F;cupcake\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;eqtylab&#x2F;cupcake</a><p>We are EQTY Lab, our mission is verifiable AI (identity, provenance, and governance). With the rise of capable agents like Claude Code, it became immediately clear that those deploying these agents need the ability to conduct their own alignment and safety controls. We can\u2019t rely solely on the frontier labs.<p>This is why we created the feature request for Hooks in Claude Code [2], and pivoted away from filesystem and OS-level monitoring once those hooks were implemented. Hooks provide the critical points we need:<p>* Evaluation: Checking agent intent and actions.<p>* Prevention: Stopping unsafe or unwanted actions.<p>* Modification: Adjusting the agent&#x27;s output before execution.<p>Policy-as-Code with OPA&#x2F;Rego - While many agent security papers suggest similar policy architectures using invented DSLs, Cupcake is fundamentally built on Open Policy Agent (OPA) and its policy language, Rego [3].<p>We chose Rego because it is:<p>* Industry-Robust: Widely adopted across enterprise DevSecOps and cloud-native environments.<p>* Purpose-Built: Offers unique, mature advantages for defining, managing, and enforcing policy as code.<p>* Enterprise-Oriented: This makes Cupcake compatible with existing enterprise governance frameworks.<p>Cupcake is released under the Apache-2.0 license. We will formalize a path to v1.0.0 in Q1 of 2026. This is an early preview version. The goal with Cupcake is not suppression, but to ensure an agent is able to drive fast without crashing.

LLMs temporarily killed my motivation to continue learning C. I wanted to build a clipboard history similar to windows 11, but for a Linux-based OS. Prompted ChatGPT for the code, and it spit some out. It was pretty bad, nowhere near a finished project. I deleted the LLM code and started anew.<p>I remembered <i>why</i> I wanted to learn this stuff. It&#x27;s not for money, or to look cool.<p>It&#x27;s for the fascination I have for computing.<p>How do electrons flow through a wire? How do the chips within a computer direct that flow to produce an image on a screen? These questions are mind-blowing for me. I don&#x27;t think LLMs can kill this fascination. Although, for web programming, sure. I always hated front-end programming, and now I don&#x27;t really have to do it (I don&#x27;t have the same fascination for the <i>why</i> of such tech).
