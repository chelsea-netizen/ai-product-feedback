I had always managed my personal budget with Excel with occasional jumps into Mint, Monarch, Quicken, MS Money, and I forget what else.<p>Those tools serve a purpose and I liked all of them for many good reasons, but I have always wanted an application that specifically focused on what I did in the last month, what is happening this week, and what&#x27;s coming up in the next month. I wanted to be able to do What-Ifs easily for vacations or large purchases. I also have five Gen-Z kids I still support in varying ways and I wanted to track that.<p>Ledga has all of these features, including a mobile web app that&#x27;s mostly meant to be a snapshot of your current cash flow.<p>I do need to purchase a Windows Code Signing certificate, so if you download the Windows version now, you have to deal with the warnings. The MacOS Zip is notarized (Apple is horrible about notarizing apps in a timely manner and I rarely get the dmg through the process).
