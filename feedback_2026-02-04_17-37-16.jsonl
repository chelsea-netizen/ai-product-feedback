The attack surface is tool-output injection \u2014 the AI&#x27;s environment (diffs, comments, linked issues) becomes a vector.<p>Working on detection for this class of attacks at PromptShield.

Like many of you, I hit the limits on subscriptions and watched costs spiral. I&#x27;ve tried cutting corners, explored cheaper models (quality is not there yet), ran local models through ollama, did a lot of optimizations to use less tokens.<p>But finally hit the wall with OpenClaw&#x2F;Molt agent. Usage spiked over the roof and although I see a lot of value in having my personal Jarvis, but ROI is not there yet.<p>At some point I realized that the real issue is not price itself, it\u2019s access + predictability. Some people&#x2F;companies have more capacity than they need at times, others are paying retail while trying to scale.<p>So I&#x27;m building commodity market for LLM tokens.<p>Sellers can:<p>* Offer OpenAI capacity on their terms\n* Set a floor price (% of retail)\n* Control timing and volume<p>Buyers can:<p>* Bid below retail\n* Get OpenRouter-compatible API access\n* Pay only for what they use<p>Under the hood:<p>* Bid&#x2F;ask realtime orderbook matching (like a stock exchange)\n* &lt;10ms added latency\n* API keys encrypted\n* Every transaction metadata is logged (not content)<p>Why I\u2019m posting:<p>I need 20 people to test this MVP:<p>* 10 sellers (you have OpenAI spend &#x2F; capacity you can make available)\n* 10 buyers (you want cheaper, reliable access)<p>Current limits (for now):<p>* OpenAI only\n* Manual onboarding\n* Very basic web UI<p>---<p>If you\u2019re interested:<p>1.
